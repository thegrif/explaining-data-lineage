February nights in St. Petersburg are long and dark. A cold wind roams through the deserted streets of the haughty city, throwing sleet in the faces of random passers-by. "On such nights, it's good to be at home, lying on a wide bed under a thick blanket, snuggling up to a warm female body... And the streets are cold and scary. And you won't meet anyone but bandits and cops. And it is still unknown which of them is scarier." Something like this was the opinion of the former head lab and candidate of Sciences, and now a private cab driver, who slowly plied the old Moskvich on Vasilyevsky Island in a hopeless search for a client.

At the corner of Maly and Detskaya, the candidate driver slowed down so that the Moskvich wouldn't crumble into the holes and potholes of the intersection. To the right of the car, the former university dormitory was blackened by the empty eye sockets of broken windows; to the left, the Smolensk Cemetery began. Although he was a former head of the department with a PhD in very materialistic biological sciences, he felt a superstitious fear suddenly cool his stomach. "A fun place. There will definitely be no customers here, except for the souls of the restless, " the driver tried to cheer himself up with a joke and suddenly froze with horror, automatically pressing the brake pedal to the floor. Out of the darkness of the cemetery, a black shadow slid toward the car. A dirt-smeared hand thumped against the glass.
